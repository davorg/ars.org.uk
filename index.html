        <h1>ars.org.uk</h1>
        <p>Many years ago I decided I was going to write an "Agency Rating
        System" where IT contractors could rate the agencies that they
        worked with.</p>
        <p>I bought the domain <tt>ars.org.uk</tt> because ARS stands for
        "Agency Rating System" and also because it sounds a lot like "arse"
        <br>(which gives you some idea of how contractors think of agents).</p>
        <p>The project didn't last long. Back then (and we're talking 1999)
        people seemed less keen on being nasty online than they are now.
        <br>And I had a couple of legal threats from agencies who people
        <strong>had</strong> been honest about. So I killed the site.</p>
        <p>But I was loathe to give up the domain. It was the only
        three-letter domain that I ever registered.<br>And, anyway, it still
        sounds like "arse". Which is always funny.</p>
        <p>So here the site sits. Doing nothing.</p>
